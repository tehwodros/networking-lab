## Prerequisites

- **Azure CLI** installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- **Terraform** installed (1.4+)
- **jq** installed for JSON parsing ([Download jq](https://jqlang.org/download/))
- **Azure credentials** available to Terraform/CLI (Azure CLI login or env vars)

---

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd azure/scripts
   ```

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The setup script will display SSH connection instructions when complete.

**Cost**: ~$0.50-1.00/session. Destroy when done.

---

## Getting Help

If you run into issues (broken instructions, validation failures you can’t explain, or suspected bugs), please open a **GitHub Issue** in this repo:

- [Open an issue](../issues/new/choose)
- Include: incident ID (e.g., INC-4521), what you tried, and `./validate.sh` output (redact secrets/tokens).

## Incident Queue

You're on call. Four tickets just came in. Your job: diagnose and fix.

### 🎫 INC-4521: API service can't pull external data

**Priority:** High  
**Reported by:** Backend Team  
**Time:** 09:47 AM

> "Our API service that runs on the private subnet stopped being able to fetch data from external APIs this morning. We didn't change anything on our end. Requests to third-party services just hang and timeout. Internal calls between our services still work fine."

**Affected system:** API server (private subnet)

---

### 🎫 INC-4522: Service discovery broken

**Priority:** High  
**Reported by:** Platform Team  
**Time:** 10:15 AM

> "Our applications can't resolve internal hostnames anymore. We've been using `web.internal.local`, `api.internal.local`, and `db.internal.local` for service discovery but they stopped resolving. Public DNS works fine - we can resolve google.com. This is blocking deployments."

**Affected system:** All VMs

---

### 🎫 INC-4523: Web frontend can't reach backend

**Priority:** Critical  
**Reported by:** Web Team  
**Time:** 10:32 AM

> "The web frontend suddenly can't connect to the API backend. We're getting connection refused errors on port 8080. The API health endpoint works when we curl localhost on the API server itself, so the service is running. Also, the API team says they can't reach the database on port 5432."

**Affected systems:** Web server → API server, API server → Database

---

### 🎫 INC-4524: Security audit findings

**Priority:** Medium  
**Reported by:** Security Team  
**Time:** 11:00 AM

> "Our quarterly security scan flagged several issues with the network segmentation:
> 
> 1. SSH is accessible from the internet on some hosts (should only be via bastion)
> 2. The database is directly accessible from the bastion host on port 5432 — it should only be reachable from the API tier subnet
> 3. ICMP is open from anywhere
> 
> These need to be tightened up before our compliance review next week."

**Affected systems:** Network security groups

---

## Verify Your Fixes

The validation script tests actual connectivity—not just configuration. It SSHs into the VMs and runs the same checks a user would to confirm services are reachable.

**When to use it:**
- After fixing an incident to confirm it's resolved
- When you think you're done with all incidents
- To generate a completion token for submission

**Check incident status:**

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd azure/scripts
   ```

2. Run validation:
   ```bash
   ./validate.sh
   ```

**Generate completion token:**

1. Run export:
   ```bash
   ./validate.sh export
   ```

2. Enter your GitHub username when prompted

3. Store your token from the output for submission, we are working on the verification system and will provide submission instructions soon.

## Troubleshooting

### `terraform destroy` fails with errors

If `./destroy.sh` exits with errors, it is most likely because you created cloud resources while resolving the incidents that are not tracked by Terraform. Terraform cannot delete resources it does not manage, and some Azure resources cannot be deleted while dependent resources still exist.

Read the error message carefully — it will name the resource that is blocking deletion. Research how to delete that resource using the Azure CLI, then run `./destroy.sh` again.

## Clean Up

When finished, destroy resources to avoid charges:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd azure/scripts
   ```

2. Run the destroy script:
   ```bash
   ./destroy.sh
   ```

> **Note:** If `terraform destroy` fails, it's likely because you created resources via the Azure CLI (e.g., DNS VNet links, NSG rules) that Terraform doesn't know about. Delete those resources manually with `az` first, then re-run `./destroy.sh`.
